In our class we went over the code posted at: 
https://pastebin.com/dwZqBs4u
But we ran into a bunch of problems.

First, we were unable to instantiate the Object class. Explain that.

Second, we saw that with the notifyAll() uncommented, and the keyword 
synchonized removed from the method declarations, the program just died 
without throwing any exceptions. Given that we are working with an 
infinite loop here, that shouldn't have happened. Explain that.



1) I copied and pasted the code and tried to instiate a new object on my computer and it worked fine. I think that the path to the Object class might have been corrupted on the computer in class.

2) Because synchronized was removed, I think there were two threads trying to access the same resource so the compiler doesnt know which thread to start first causing a race condition.
